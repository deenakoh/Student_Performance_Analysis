In today's fast-paced and competitive educational environment, understanding the factors that influence
student success is more important than ever. Just like the transport system in a bustling city like London must
adapt to serve its residents, schools and educators must adapt to meet the needs of students. In this project,
we will take a deep dive into a dataset containing rich details about various aspects of student life, such as
hours studied, sleep patterns, attendance, and more, to uncover what truly impacts exam performance.
The dataset we'll be working with includes a wide range of factors influencing student performance. By
analyzing this data, we'll be able to identify key drivers of success and provide insights that could help
students, teachers, and policymakers make informed decisions.
